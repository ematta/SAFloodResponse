## Complexity Issues
1. Authentication Repository Duplication
   
   - There are two AuthRepository implementations (one in root package, one in repository package) causing confusion and potential conflicts
   - The repository has too many responsibilities handling both Firebase auth and local database operations
2. Incomplete Profile Management
   
   - The profile creation UI is incomplete while the editing UI exists
   - Profile picture upload functionality is missing
   - Location preferences settings are not implemented
3. Error Handling Gaps
   
   - Error handling in login and registration screens is incomplete
   - Network connectivity issues aren't properly communicated to users
## Implementation Errors
1. Authentication Error Handling
   
   - Firebase-specific authentication errors aren't properly translated to user-friendly messages
   - Network connectivity checks exist but error recovery paths are incomplete
2. Profile Management
   
   - The ProfileScreen lacks proper profile creation functionality
   - There's no clear flow from registration to profile creation
3. Interface Inconsistencies
   
   - Inconsistency between AuthViewModel and AuthRepository interfaces
   - Some methods are suspending in one interface but not in the other
## Recommended Improvements
1. Simplify Repository Structure
   
   - Consolidate the two AuthRepository implementations
   - Separate concerns: split Firebase auth and local database operations
2. Complete Profile Management
   
   - Implement the missing profile creation UI
   - Add profile picture upload functionality
   - Implement location preferences settings
3. Enhance Error Handling
   
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for all authentication scenarios
   - Add user-friendly error messages for common authentication failures
   - Improve offline mode handling
